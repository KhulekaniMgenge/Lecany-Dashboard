# Recommendations
Given the low NPS, Lecany should focus on improving the customer experience, possibly by addressing specific pain points identified in customer feedback. Enhancing the online and in-store shopping experience could increase satisfaction and encourage more customers to recommend the shop. Second, the strong influence of social media in customer discovery suggests that Lecany should invest more in social media marketing campaigns, including promotions and customer engagement activities. Lastly, given the diverse age distribution, targeted marketing strategies that cater to the preferences of different age groups could help in attracting and retaining a broader customer base. These steps will likely improve overall satisfaction and increase the likelihood of positive word-of-mouth recommendations.
